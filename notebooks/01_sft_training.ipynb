    "# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on IMDb Movie Reviews (Supervised Fine-Tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I fine-tune a GPT-2 model on the full IMDb movie review dataset. This stage corresponds to the **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** part of the project, where the goal is to train GPT-2 to write text in the style of real movie reviews. Using the complete reviews (not summaries) helps the model pick up the natural flow, vocabulary, and structure found in long-form user reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key choices for this stage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset:** I use the full IMDb review text so the model learns to generate complete reviews rather than short summaries.\n",
    "- **Training setup:** I rely on the Hugging Face *Trainer* API since it takes care of batching, gradient accumulation, evaluation, and saving checkpoints, which makes the workflow much smoother.\n",
    "- **Model:** I fine-tune **GPT-2 Medium (355M parameters)**. With mixed-precision (FP16), it fits on the GPU and produces noticeably better generations than the smaller 124M version.\n",
    "- **Logging:** Training metrics are logged to **Weights & Biases (wandb)**, and I also generate local Matplotlib plots of the loss curves for the report.\n",
    "- **Evaluation:** Besides loss, I track next-token accuracy. This number is naturally small because of the large vocabulary, but it still gives a sense of whether the model is improving during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this stage, I obtain a fine-tuned GPT-2 Medium checkpoint and generate several sample reviews to see how well the model learned the writing style.\n",

    "\n",
    "After training, I extract the logs recorded by the `Trainer` to analyze how the model behaved during optimization. The log history contains both training loss (recorded every few steps) and validation loss (recorded at the end of each epoch). Separating these makes it easier to visualize how quickly the model converged and whether it began to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is computed by exponentiating the loss values. Although it can be sensitive to long-tail tokens, it still provides a useful sense of how well the model predicts the next token on average. I report both the final validation perplexity and the approximate perplexity based on the last logged training loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I plot the training and validation loss curves to get a clearer picture of the learning dynamics. This helps confirm that the model is improving steadily and that the evaluations align with the trends seen during training.\n"

This metric checks how often the model’s most likely prediction matches the true next token. Although accuracy is naturally low for large-vocabulary language models, it still provides a useful sanity check on whether the model is improving and behaving consistently on seen and unseen data.\n",

    "To see how the fine-tuned model writes after training, I run a few short prompts through the generator. Each prompt is expanded into a short continuation that reflects the style and patterns the model learned from the IMDb reviews. I enable nucleus sampling (top-p) and top-k filtering so the outputs are varied and not overly deterministic. The goal here is not to evaluate quality numerically, but simply to get a qualitative sense of how well the model has absorbed the review-writing style.\n",
